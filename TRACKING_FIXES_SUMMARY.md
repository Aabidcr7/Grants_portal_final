# Grant Tracking System - Fixes Summary (Updated)

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Active Tracking Count Not Showing in Venture Analyst Dashboard** ✅
**Problem:** The "Active Tracking" card showed 0 because it only counted tracking entries for the selected startup, not all entries created by the venture analyst.

**Solution:** 
- Added new backend endpoint `/api/tracking/all` that returns all tracking entries created by the venture analyst across all startups
- Updated frontend to load all tracking data on component mount
- Changed "Active Tracking", "Applied", and "Disbursed" cards to use `allTrackingData` instead of `trackingData`
- **NEW:** Added "All My Tracking Entries" section showing ALL tracking with startup names, edit/delete buttons

### 1b. **Tracking Not Visible in Venture Analyst Dashboard** ✅
**Problem:** After creating tracking for Acube company, it wasn't showing in the main dashboard view.

**Solution:**
- Added prominent "All My Tracking Entries" section at the top showing ALL tracking entries created by the venture analyst
- Shows startup name, grant name, status, progress, notes, amounts for each entry
- Includes edit and delete buttons for each entry
- Counters update immediately after create/edit/delete operations

### 2. **Screenshot Upload Validation for "Applied" Status**
**Problem:** No validation to ensure screenshots are uploaded when status is changed to "Applied"

**Solution:**
- Added validation in `handleUpdateTracking()` to check if screenshot is uploaded
- Made screenshot field required with red asterisk (*)
- Shows confirmation when screenshot is selected or already uploaded
- Prevents update if screenshot is missing for "Applied" status

### 3. **Disbursed Amount Validation for "Approved/Disbursed" Status**
**Problem:** No validation to ensure amount is entered when status is "Approved" or "Disbursed"

**Solution:**
- Added validation in `handleUpdateTracking()` to check if amount is entered
- Made disbursed amount field required with red asterisk (*)
- Prevents update if amount is missing for "Approved" or "Disbursed" status

### 4. **Data Storage in CSV** ✅
**Status:** Already implemented and working correctly
- All tracking data (including screenshot paths and disbursed amounts) is stored in `backend/data/grant_tracking.csv`
- Screenshot files are stored in `backend/uploads/screenshots/`

### 5. **Tracking Not Showing for Free/Premium Tier Startups (e.g., Acube)** ✅
**Problem:** When logging in as Acube company (free tier), tracking was empty even though venture analysts had created tracking entries for them.

**Solution:**
- **Backend Fix:** Updated `/api/tracking/expert/{startup_id}` endpoint to allow `free`, `premium`, and `expert` tiers (previously only expert tier)
- **Frontend Fix:** Added tracking display sections to **Free Tier** and **Premium Tier** dashboards
- All startups can now see tracking entries created for them by venture analysts
- Tracking shows grant name, status, progress, analyst name, disbursed amount, and notes

## Technical Changes
