## 🔒 Security Notes

1. Admin accounts bypass screening requirement
2. Role-based endpoint protection using dependencies
3. Assignments tracked with admin ID for audit trail
4. Password hashing uses bcrypt

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**Issue:** Venture analyst sees all startups
- **Fix:** Ensure assignments exist in `startup_assignments.csv`
- **Check:** Backend endpoint returns correct filtered list

**Issue:** Admin can't create users
- **Fix:** Verify admin tier in users.csv
- **Check:** Backend validates admin role properly

**Issue:** Grants not showing
- **Fix:** Ensure grants.csv has proper data
- **Check:** Grant ID format matches

---

## 📈 Future Enhancements

- [ ] Email notifications for assignments
- [ ] Assignment history tracking
- [ ] Bulk grant upload via CSV
- [ ] Analytics dashboard for admins
- [ ] Role permissions customization
- [ ] Startup performance metrics

---

## 📝 Notes

- Admin password in CSV needs proper bcrypt hashing
- Multi-select uses existing component from `ui/multi-select.jsx`
- All admin operations are logged with admin ID
- Assignments can be updated (reassigning removes old, adds new)

---
